`ade4TkGUI` is a Tcl/Tk GUI for some statistical functions of the `ade4` package and uses the graphical functions of the `adegraphics` package.

The `ade4` package contains Data Analysis functions to analyse Ecological and Environmental data in the framework of Euclidean Exploratory methods. To learn more about `ade4`, see [the web site](http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/ADE-4/) and the [GitHub page](https://github.com/adeverse/ade4), and for `adegraphics`, see the [GitHub page](https://github.com/adeverse/adegraphics).

The `ade4TkGUI` package mixes the advantages of a GUI (ease to use, no need to learn numerous commands) with the possibility to use R expressions in the dialog boxes, to generate understandable R commands, and to manage a session history file.

Installing some dependencies
-------------

You must install the `ade4` and `adegraphics` packages in a stable version from CRAN or in a development one from GitHub.

```r
install_github("adeverse/ade4")
install_github("adeverse/adegraphics")
```

or

```r
install.packages("ade4")
install.packages("adegraphics")
```



Installing the development version of `ade4TkGUI`
-------------

- Install the release version of `remotes` from CRAN with `install.packages("remotes")`.

- Make sure you have a working development environment.
    * **Windows**: Install [Rtools](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).
    * **Mac**: Install Xcode from the Mac App Store.
    * **Linux**: Install a compiler and various development libraries (details vary across different flavors of Linux).
    
Then:

```r
remotes::install_github("adeverse/ade4TkGUI")
```


If you do not wish to install the development environments Rtools (Windows) / XCode (Mac), we can supply binary packages of the development version of `ade4TkGUI` on request. 



Installing the stable version of `ade4TkGUI`
-------------

```r
install.packages("ade4TkGUI")
```


Loading `ade4TkGUI`
-------------

```r
library("ade4TkGUI")
```


## Start with `ade4TkGUI`

The core of the package is the `ade4TkGUI()` function which opens this main GUI window :
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
![fig-figure1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13218953/10664478/03bbcdcc-78c4-11e5-9ee5-2025e5a06242.png)
<br/>
<br/>

Only a limited subset of `ade4` functions is displayed. Less frequently used functions are available through the menus of the menu bar, located at the top of the window.

The `ade4TkGUI()` function takes two arguments, `show` and `history`. The first one determines wether the R commands generated by the GUI should be printed in the console. If the `history` argument is set to TRUE, the commands generated by the GUI are also stored in the `.Rhistory` file, where they can easily be retrieved by the user.
